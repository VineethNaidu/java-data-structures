1. Scalability
    Application has ability to handle more traffic and work loads(more users, data, traffic)
    over time without performance degradation.

    Types of Scalability:
        1. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
            Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to a single machine.
            Example: Upgrading a single database server to handle more traffic.

        2. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
            Adding more machines to distribute the load.
            Example: Adding multiple web servers behind a load balancer.

    Eg: Google Search, Netflix

    Best Practices for Scalability:
        ✔ Use Microservices instead of monolithic architecture.
        ✔ Implement Load Balancers (NGINX, AWS ELB).
        ✔ Use Database Sharding or Read Replicas.
        ✔ Use Asynchronous Processing (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

2. Reliability
    System consistently performs without failure under expected conditions.

    Key Aspects:
        1. Fault Tolerance – Can recover from hardware/software failures.
        2. Redundancy – Backup components to avoid single points of failure.
        3. Error Handling – Graceful error recovery.

    Real-World Example
        1. Amazon AWS: Uses multiple data centers to ensure uptime, even if one fails.
        2. Banking Systems: Handle millions of transactions with failover mechanisms.

    Best Practices for Reliability
        ✔ Use Replication & Backups for databases.
        ✔ Implement Circuit Breaker Patterns (Netflix Hystrix).
        ✔ Perform Chaos Testing (Simulating failures).
        ✔ Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana.

3. Maintainability:
    Ability to modify, debug, and extend code without breaking existing functionality.

    Key Aspects:
        1. Modularity – Breaking software into small, reusable components.
        2. Version Control – Using Git for tracking changes.
        3. Automated Testing – Ensuring changes don’t introduce new bugs.

    Real-World Example
        1. Linux Kernel: Open-source with clear modularity and version control.
        2. Enterprise Software: Uses CI/CD pipelines for safe updates.

    Best Practices for Maintainability
        ✔ Follow SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.).
        ✔ Write Unit & Integration Tests (JUnit, Mockito).
        ✔ Document code & APIs properly.

    Real-World Example
        1. Python: Uses PEP8 for code formatting.
        2. Java: Uses Javadoc for API documentation.

    Best Practices for Readability
        ✔ Follow naming conventions for variables, functions, etc.
        ✔ Use comments to explain complex code.
        ✔ Use consistent indentation, spacing, etc.
        ✔ Document code & APIs properly.

5. Extensibility:
    Ability to add new functionality without modifying existing code.

    Key Aspects:
        1. Modularity – Breaking software into small, reusable components.
        2. Open/Closed Principle – Adding new features without modifying existing code.
        3. Dependency Injection – Injecting dependencies via constructor or setter methods.

    Real-World Example
        1. Spring Boot: Uses Dependency Injection for easy extensibility.
        2. Angular: Uses Dependency Injection for easy extensibility.
        3. Chrome Extensions: Users can add new functionality to Chrome.
        4. Spring Boot Framework: Allows easy integration of new services.

    Best Practices for Extensibility
        ✔ Follow SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.).
        ✔ Use Dependency Injection for easy extensibility.
        ✔ Document code & APIs properly.
