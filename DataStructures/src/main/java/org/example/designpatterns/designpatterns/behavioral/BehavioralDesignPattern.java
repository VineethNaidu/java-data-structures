/*
BDP focus on interaction and communication between objects. BDP helps to define how objects interact and distribute their responsibilities.

Types of Behavioral Design Patterns:
1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2. Command Pattern
3. Iterator Pattern
4. Mediator Pattern
5. Memento Pattern
6. Observer Pattern
7. State Pattern
8. Strategy Pattern
9. Template Pattern

Most Used Behavioral Design Patterns:
1. Strategy	 -> Choose algorithm at runtime -> Choosing payment method: UPI / Card / Wallet -> Spring Converter, Comparator
2. Observer -> Notify multiple objects of state changes -> Newsletters, Push notifications -> Spring @EventListener, GUI listeners
3. Command -> Encapsulate a request as an object -> Remote control → volume up/down	 -> Undo/Redo, Task queues
4. Chain of Responsibility -> Pass request through a chain of handlers -> Support ticket: Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 -> Spring Security Filters, Servlet Filters
5. State -> Change behavior based on state	-> Music player: Playing / Paused / Stopped	-> UI state handling, Game states
6. Template Method -> Skeleton of algorithm with customizable steps -> Make tea/coffee: boil → brew → add milk -> Spring’s JdbcTemplate, AbstractController
7. Iterator -> Traverse a collection without exposing details -> for-each loop in Java -> Iterator, ListIterator in Java collections
