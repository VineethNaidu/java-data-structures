/*
Def: Bridge DP is a structural DP that lets u split a large class or set of closely related classes
into two separate hierarchies â€” abstraction and implementation. - Which can be developed independently.

Eg: Remote Control and Devices
    1. A Remote Control (interface to control something)
    2. Multiple devices like TV, Radio, Projector, etc.

    Note: The bridge is the abstraction (Remote) connected to implementation (Device) via composition, not inheritance.

When to Use:
    1. When you want to separate the abstraction from its implementation.
    2. When you want to avoid a class from changing its behavior based on its implementation.
    3. When multiple implementations can change independently (e.g. UI themes + platforms).
