What you can do in Subclass:
1. You can call Parent Class Constructor.
2. You can call Parent Class Method.
3. You can call Parent Class Field.
4. You can override Parent Class Method.
5. You can override Parent Class Field.
6. You can add new Field.
7. You can add new Method.
8. You can add new Constructor.
9. You can add new Nested Class.
10. You can add new Inner Class.
11. You can add new Interface.
12. You can add new Abstract Method.
13. You can add new Static Method.
14. You can add new Static Field.
15. You can add override Static Method.
16. You can add override Static Field.
17. You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature
    as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.

/*
Note:
1*.   A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass
      has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.
2***. A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods.
      Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the
      private members of the superclass.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
Feature	            Description
Inheritance	        Allows a class to inherit properties from another class
Types	            Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical (Multiple via Interfaces)
Overriding	        Child class can redefine parent methods
super keyword	    Calls parent methods or constructor
final keyword	    Prevents overriding or inheritance
